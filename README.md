# Some platformer experiments for creating a platform game

This was an experiment to create a Metroidvania for the Sega Master System; originally made for the "[Metroidvania Month 17](https://itch.io/jam/metroidvania-month-17)".

What is available here is basically the GSLib example code, slightly modified to work as a platform. Not even the graphics were modified. Still, it can be useful as an ugly example of how to implement a platformer on GSLib.
